All of the content found on this site falls under several different
categories with regard to licensing. I've been asked by people if they
can reproduce parts of it, that fall under each of these separate areas,
so I've put together the relevant copyright information for each one below.

* Content of the reproduced article is unmodified
  (translations to languages other than English are fine)
* My name (Liu Qing) is cited as the author
